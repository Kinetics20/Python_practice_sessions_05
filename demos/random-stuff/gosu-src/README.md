## DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR ANYTHING
No, seriously. It was written in 2003-2004 for a university course ("basics of programming" or sth) project, and it's probably full of bugs and other nasty stuff.

I'm posting it here since I want to do a code review of it on my livestream.

Here's the project logo though - I actually still like it.
